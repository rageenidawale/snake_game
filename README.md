## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Start the Game:**  
   - The snake moves automatically.
   - Use the arrow keys to control its direction:  
     - ⬆️ `Up Arrow` → Move Up  
     - ⬇️ `Down Arrow` → Move Down  
     - ⬅️ `Left Arrow` → Move Left  
     - ➡️ `Right Arrow` → Move Right  

2. **Score Points:**  
   - The snake eats food to grow and increases the score.

3. **Game Over Conditions:**  
   - Hitting the wall resets the game.  
   - Colliding with its own tail resets the game.
